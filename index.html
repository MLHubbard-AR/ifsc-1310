            <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

            <p>Progressive Enhancement is a useful tool because it can help to build your website that can work (or be used) on many different devices. It's main focus is on the content. I like the example that was given about the M&M's. It brought things
                into perspective.<br> What I got from this reading is that if we start with the content and work our way outward to the presentation and the end result, we can come up with a great website. Not only will it be a great site but with the
                application of JavaScript to help with <br>the styling of the content. You can't go wrong. </p>

            <p> In this field things will always change, we need to make sure our websites are progressively enhanced if they are we can use new features that come out and make sure our sites are accessible to everyone who uses them.</p>

            <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
            <p> I worked on this project a few semesters ago and I was not pleased with the outcome. This time I feel a little better about how my site came out. One good thing that came out of this semester for me is that I realized that I am capable of
                doing this. <br>In the past I've always had classmates that were willing to help me when I got stuck on something or Mr. Wallace being readily available to answer any question that I may have. I still need to work on figuring out the layout
                of things. But I won't give up. </p>
            <p> The feedback I received was to change the typography and to work on my navigation which was not positioned correctly. I was able to center my navigation by adjusting the width and the font size. I also added a white background to my navigation
                <br>to make it stand out a little better. My grandson pointed out to me that my table on my about page was not centered to the background so I added a border and adjusted the margins to auto. </p>
            <p>This semester has been very different due to the pandemic. I'm not use to taking classes on line but, this is what we have. The one thing that I feel would be of assistance to me is, before I start a project, take the time to maybe do a storyboard
                of some sort <br> that will help me to see how I want my page to be laid out. I have learned so much more about html and css. I'm still working on learning JavaScript. I have some knowledge of it because of previous classes but I must
                admit I don't have the best understanding of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wallace makes it so interesting I actually search for new things to learn. I plan to continue learning all I can in this field. </p>
